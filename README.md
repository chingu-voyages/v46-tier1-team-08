Title: This application is called Recipes

Overview: Recipes is an app created to help users to manage and organize their recipe collections. 

Possible features: check off ingredients, like & share buttons, reviews section, user profile for saving favourite recipes.

Running the project:

Dependencies: node, Vite

(notes for installing vite: npm create vite@latest, choose React from list, choose JavaScript from list, cd into folder (seems to need to have a folder to go into or else it will create its own - biggest issue with creating vite install as I'm not sure I understand how it works beyond running the server so I can see what it looks like in browser), npm install, npm run dev)
